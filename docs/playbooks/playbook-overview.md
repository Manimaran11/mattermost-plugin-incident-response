# Overview

Playbooks are preconfigured workflows that are used during an incident to provide guidance to all stakeholders and ensure successful incident resolution. Playbooks are created prior to an incident, so that they're available immediately.

Within playbooks are stages and steps, which can be initiated with custom slash commands and assigned to individual team members.
