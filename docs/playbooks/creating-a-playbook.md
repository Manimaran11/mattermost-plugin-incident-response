# Creating a Playbook

A playbook must be defined before starting an incident.

1. Navigate to **Main Menu > Incidents & Playbooks**.
2. Click **Playbooks** in the top menu.
3. Select a template, or click **+ New Playbook** to start a new playbook from scratch.
4. Name your playbook.
5. Rename the **Default Stage**, defining one or more steps to be taken by members of the incident.
6. Optionally use descriptions on steps to add additional context for members of the incident. Descriptions support a limited form of markdown, including text styling and hyperlinks.
7. Optionally define a slash command with the step, simplifying the completion of steps in the incident.
8. Configure whether the incident channel should be public or private within the team.
9. Optionally share this playbook with other members of the team to allow them to use the playbook to start an incident, as well as edit the stages, steps and configuration.
