# Overview

Incident Response is a Mattermost plugin designed to help organizations monitor, coordinate, and measure their incident response processes, increasing transparency, maximizing effectiveness, and ultimately saving costs by cutting down time taken to respond and resolve incidents.

Incidents are situations which require an immediate response and benefit from a clearly defined process guiding towards resolution. A playbook defines this process, initializing a dedicated channel for the incident with steps grouped into stages for members of the incident to follow. When the situation is resolved, the incident is ended, and the playbook can be updated to improve the response to similar incidents in the future.

Playbooks and incidents are scoped by teams, and cannot be shared between teams.
