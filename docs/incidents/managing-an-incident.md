# Managing an Incident

## Viewing incident details

Members are able to do the following via both the RHS and the messaging interface:
- See who is the incident commander
- See the current stage
- See the remaining tasks
- See the finished tasks
- Assign a step to themselves or another incident member
- Mark a step as **Complete** or **Incomplete**
- Start an automated action
- Invite new members to the channel



## Changing the incident owner

An incident member can assign the incident commander role to themselves, or any other incident member, in the RHS.
