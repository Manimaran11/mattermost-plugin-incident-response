# Ending an Incident

The owner of the incident can end it via either a slash command or the right-hand sidebar.

Ending an incident signals to all participants that the issue has been resolved. Some playbooks may define stages and tasks to complete after an incident has been resolved, such as scheduling and completing a post-mortem. The incident RHS remains fully accessible even after an incident has ended.
